# TV and Movie Data Exploration (Medium Article)
Exploratory Data Analysis of two Kaggle datasets for TV Shows (1) and Movies (2) compared between Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Disney+ streaming platforms. The information collected from this notebook was implemented in a RnR (Research and Reflect) paper generated for Medium.com.

# Introduction
Being a data scientist, an analyst, or an engineer isn't just about writing code and using math. Well-rounded data professionals are the ones who regularly research new topics. Some take things even further and also share their insight with their peers. It's a well-known fact that employers love candidates who have a blog and write interesting articles, technical or otherwise.

Even if the blog is non-technical, employers dig through it because it demonstrates that a candidate has strong research, analysis, and written communication skills. Moreover, regular posting also showcases preservance and commitment.

Our RnR (Research and Reflect) projects are designed to help you practice these soft skills by writing short pieces on technical topics.

You will research a topic to explore (a new technology, algorithm, or an interesting dataset) and write about it.

# Mandatory Peer Reviews
Lighthouse will assign you a peer reviewer. Upon completing a draft version of your writeup, you will send it to your peer for review. Part of your tasks this weekend will be to read and provide feedback to your pair about their writeup, as well as update your writeup based on their feedback.

Through peer review, you will either read about a different topic or read a different perspective to the same one that you selected.

# Timelines
Today: Research topic.
Week 8 - Friday: Submit the draft to a peer.
Week 9 - Friday: Submit feedback to a peer.
Week 10 - Friday: Revise and finalize; Submit to Lighthouse.

# Publishing Is Recommended, Not Required
Our ultimate hope is that you will make this article publicly viewable and even include a link to it on your website, LinkedIn profile, and/or CV.

That said, you are not required to publish it. If you don't wish to publish your writeup, you are still required to submit it to us privately (via Compass) and to your assigned peer reviewer.

# Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have put together your first writeup with your take on a specific topic in data science. It should have provided an excellent opportunity to practice open-ended research and writing skills, and perhaps even showcase your ability to do so to future employers.
